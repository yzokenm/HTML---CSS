Project: Personal Portfolio Website
Requirements:

    1 => Structure & Semantic HTML:
        Use proper HTML5 semantic tags such as <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, etc.
        Create sections for:
            About Me
            Projects
            Contact Information
            Skills

    2 => Classes and Selectors:
        Use classes for styling specific sections (e.g., .projects-section, .about-section) and apply consistent naming conventions.
        Apply CSS selectors to style elements globally and contextually (e.g., .projects-section h2).

    3 => Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements:
        Use pseudo-classes like :hover to change the appearance of links, buttons, or images when hovered over.
        Use :before or :after pseudo-elements to add decorative content to certain elements (e.g., underlining headings or adding icons before items).
        
    4 => Positioning Layouts:
        Use CSS properties like position(fixed, sticky, relative, absolute) to arrange sections on the page.
        Ensure that the layout is well-structured and responsive.
        Include a sticky navigation bar at the top using position: sticky;.
    
    5 => Dynamic Links with IDs:
        Use href and IDs to create navigation links within the page, allowing users to jump between sections (e.g., About, Projects, Contact).
        Ensure these links smoothly scroll to the relevant sections.
    
    6 => Media Queries:
        Make the portfolio responsive with media queries.
        Ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
        Provide at least 2 breakpoints for tablets and mobile screens.

    7 => Bonus (Optional):
        Add simple transitions or animations using transition or keyframes to enhance the look and feel of the portfolio (e.g., button hover effects, smooth scrolling).
        Implement form validation using HTML5 for a basic contact form (if included).
        
    Tools:
        HTML/CSS only (no frameworks or libraries for this exercise).
