Task: Create a Responsive Personal Portfolio Page
Header Section: Include your name and a navigation bar (Home, About, Projects, Contact).

On larger screens, display the navigation links horizontally.
On smaller screens (mobile), hide the navigation bar and replace it with a hamburger menu.
About Section: Add a short bio about yourself.

On smaller screens, center the content and use a single column layout.
On larger screens, use two columns: one for your photo and one for the text.
Projects Section: Display at least three project cards.

On smaller screens, stack the project cards vertically.
On medium screens (tablet), display two project cards per row.
On larger screens (desktop), display three project cards per row.
Contact Section: Include a simple contact form (name, email, message).

Make sure the form fields resize correctly for different screen sizes.
Footer: Add social media icons and a copyright notice.

The icons should align horizontally on larger screens and vertically on smaller screens.
Use media queries to make sure the layout adapts well to different screen sizes (e.g., mobile-first design). You can target breakpoints like:

Mobile: max-width: 600px
Tablet: min-width: 601px and max-width: 1024px
Desktop: min-width: 1025px
